# KTH Tangrams data set

There is a growing body of research focused on task-oriented instructor-manipulator dialogue, whereby one dialogue participant initiates
a reference to an entity in a common environment while the other participant must resolve this reference in order to manipulate said
entity. Many of these works are based on disparate if nevertheless similar datasets. This is an English corpus of referring
expressions in relatively free, unrestricted dialogue with physical features generated in a simulation, which facilitate analysis of dialogic
linguistic phenomena regarding alignment in the formation of referring expressions known as conceptual pacts.
